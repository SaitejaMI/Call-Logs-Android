# Call-Logs-Android
This is an application in which we can store complete call logs/history to the database with duration, name and cell number and we can also display it in our app. 
There is a button in an app on which we click to fetch all call history in list and then we will save it to MySql databse through API.

By this we can save all unknown or known numbers in our database for further use of data.
